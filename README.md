Zymplectic is a numerical integration platform intended for scientific and educational purposes. 
Zymplectic provides a highly accurate and efficient engine for simulating dynamical systems using the largest available library of symplectic integrators.
Zymplectic does not require installation and does not modify files outside its directory unless instructed to by the user.

How to use:
- Download Zymplectic (bundled with clang or gcc). Only win64 supported at this time
- Run Zymplectic
- Start any of the included example c++ scripts or use the existing scripts as templates for your own Hamiltonian systems
